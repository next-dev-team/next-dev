# Development Guide for js-universal Projects ## Non-Negotiable Execution
Workflow To guarantee every contribution follows this guide precisely, obey this
checklist **before any edits** and **again before finalizing**. Do not skip or
reorder. 1. **AGENTS Snapshot:** Re-open this file and write down (in your
working notes or response draft) the exact sections relevant to the requested
task. No work begins until this snapshot exists. 2. **Example Lock-in:**
Identify the closest matching script in `{{examples}}`. Record its path and keep
it open while editing. Every launcher change must mirror that reference unless
the user explicitly instructs otherwise. 3. **Pre-flight Checklist:** Convert
the applicable rules from this document and `PINOKIO.md` at
{{PINOKIO_DOCUMENTATION}}
into a task-specific checklist (install/start/reset/update structure, regex
patterns, menu defaults, log checks, etc.). Confirm each item is ticked
**before** making changes. 4. **Mid-task Verification:** Any time you touch a
Pinokio script, cross-check the corresponding example line to ensure syntax and
structure match. Document the reference (example path + line) in your reasoning.
5. **Exit Checklist:** Before responding to the user, revisit the pre-flight
checklist and explicitly confirm every item is satisfied. If anything diverges
from the example or these rules, fix it first. If any step cannot be completed,
stop immediately and ask the user how to proceed. These five steps are mandatory
for every session. ### Critical Pattern Lock: Capturing Web UI URL coming soon
