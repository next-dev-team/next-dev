# Context7 MCP usage (strict requirement)

MCP Context7 is available for documentation checks.
Always use Context7 when:
Uncertain or unclear about APIs, props, or TypeScript types
Checking version compatibility or mismatches
Need up-to-date documentation for any library
Compare versions between knowledge and the actual tech stack in package.json
Workflow: Check package.json → Compare versions → If unclear/mismatch → Use Context7 (resolve-library-id → get-library-docs)
